# ðŸŒŒ NASA Space App Hackathon Project 2024

Welcome to the our **NASA Space Hackathon Project Cosmovis**!  This interactive platform brings the cosmos closer, allowing users to explore and learn about our solar system, track near-Earth comets and asteroids, and chat with an AI-powered space education assistant. 

## ðŸš€ What We Built
Our team of 5 membersâ€”**Imama Kainat**, **Hassan Gulzar**, **Saira Alvi**,**Osama Ghaffar**, and **Fareeha Amir**â€”leveraged NASA's APIs to create an engaging, educational tool for space enthusiasts. The platform includes:

- **Real-time tracking** of near-Earth comets and asteroids
- **Interactive 3D models** of the solar system
- An **AI-powered chatbot** integrated with NASA's data to educate users on various space topics

### ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights
- **Astronomical Data Visualization**: Access real-time data from NASA, displayed in an interactive and user-friendly format.
- **Solar System Models**: Navigate through our solar system with 3D visualizations of planets, moons, and other celestial bodies.
- **Near-Earth Object Details**: Get comprehensive information on comets, asteroids, and other near-Earth objects.
- **Space Education Chatbot**: Chat with our AI assistant, which provides information on space missions, celestial events, and more.
